# 👋 Hey there, I'm Alan!

I'm a passionate developer who loves to create amazing things. My main focus for the last year and a half has been on a closed source enterprise application, which is why I don't have a public GitHub history.  :upside_down_face:

### 💻 Code
I specialize in React and Elixir development. My expertise in React has allowed me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while my experience with Elixir has allowed me to build robust and scalable backend systems.

### 🏂 When I'm Not Coding
When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active with hobbies like snowboarding and golf. 

### 📫 Let's Connect!
I'm excited to connect with other developers and contribute to the community here on GitHub. Let's build something awesome together!

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-mamulski/). 🤝
