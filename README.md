# 👋 Hey,

### 💻 Code
I specialize in React and Elixir development. My expertise in React has allowed me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while my experience with Elixir has allowed me to build robust and scalable backend systems.

### 🏂 When I'm Not Coding
When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active with hobbies like snowboarding and golf.
